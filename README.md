# calculator
This HTML document sets up a simple calculator web application with a straightforward and user-friendly design. It begins with essential metadata and links to an external CSS file for styling. The main content is a calculator interface featuring a large input display for showing numbers and results. The calculator includes buttons organized into rows for ease of use: basic arithmetic operators (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), a clear button ("AC"), a delete button ("DEL"), percentage button ("%"), and numerical keys (0-9), including "00" and a decimal point. An equal button (=) is provided to execute calculations. The layout ensures that the calculator is both functional and easy to navigate, with styling managed through the linked CSS file.
